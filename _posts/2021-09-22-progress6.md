### Plan & Model views

26.4㎡ (1st floor) + 9.9㎡ (2nd floor) = 36.3㎡

Compared to last time's design, I create more privacy for the teo persons living in the home, and rearrange the room to be more rational.

In the same time, I keep the underground storage idea. In addition, I add moveable doors to the kitchen and bathroom. When entering the home, the space looks clean, but actually everything is here.

In terms of the roof, I make the south and the center part as skylights to allow sunlight to go inside the upper bedroom and lower living room area; the west and east parts will be attached with solar panel; I'm considering a way to lead the rainwater to go down to the kitchen and bathroom along the roof.

Hempcrete is a biobased sustainable material suitable for building construction. It can absorb CO₂ store heat, insulate sound and fire. Plus, its growth does not need much water, and it is available in Salt Lake City. After doing some research, I determine to use it as the main material.
