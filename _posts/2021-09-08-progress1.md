This is my progress in the first class:



### Case Study of Small-Scale Residence

Project of multi-functional living room (48㎡)

A core space in the center of a home with the dweller's most important spiritual activities happening here (it is like a house in a house).

Plus, under the core space, there are a series of flexible furnitures serving for many functions around the house.

OFIS arhitekti, 20㎡

As a temporary house for tourists, it provides not only a cool facade, but also a very good view looking outwards. The minimun interior space provides all essential functions, and the house leaves quite a large "balcony" space. It looks like a future mini spacestation on Mars.
