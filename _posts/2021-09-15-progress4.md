### Initial design



![9.14](https://github.com/SunBaiqianqian/SunBaiqianqian-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/9.14%E6%96%B0plan%20section.jpg?raw=true)
Design from section--creating a loft with bedroom upstairs, and utilizing the level difference to make storage room, bathroom below. On the other side, lifting the floor to create a sinking livingroom and huge underground storage space.
