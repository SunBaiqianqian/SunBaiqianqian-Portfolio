### Client (finalized)

My client is a middle-income couple who love camping and playing sports. It is usually hard to store all the things meaningful to them (like gym equipments and large equipments for camping) in such a narrow and small space, let alone to avoid looking messy. My design is to make an affordable sustainable tiny “storage house” that could accomodate not only this couple but also the objects and activities they love and enjoy. With the name of the home "Home of My Ego", it is really a home of their egos.



### Plan & Model views

After finalizing my client and my core conceptual idea, I reorganize the home. The upstairs is a bedroom for the couple, and there are a livingroom, a working area, and a kitchen below. The bathroom and dining area are on a 50cm higher level near the entrance with a large underground storage space. The workout facilities are stored near the kitchen that is extended to a coutyard. All the things are put against the walls on either sides, leaving a large flexible space for workout. Plus, it extends to outside. The exercising environment can be natural and pleasant. The unusually used camping equipments are stored on the second floor hung up and underground, which are organized well and look not messy at all.



### Research and precendents
