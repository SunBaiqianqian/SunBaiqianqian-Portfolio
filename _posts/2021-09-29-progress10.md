Two sides of all the stuffs and furnitures are strictly following the width of 600mm and 700mm. Looking from the entrance, it is well-organized, spacious, and clean. Also, I shift the arrangement for the bedroom, making it feel more pleasant. In addition, this time, the house connects to the natural environment more. Now I have a more mature idea of the whole project.
